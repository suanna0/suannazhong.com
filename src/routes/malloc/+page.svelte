    not only pioneered well-known labs such as 
    <code>bomblab</code> and <code>attacklab</code>, but their slide 
    have been used by computer systems courses at other universities, 
    setting a higher standard for modern CS education.

    During the lab, I observed places where clearer visuals and fewer 
    words could help students grasp the key concepts more effectively. I 
    decided to create a website to explore this idea.

    The opening page is interactive, functioning as a black-box 
    representation of <code>malloc</code>. To keep the code clean, I 
    used a Model View Controller structure to separate mouse 
    interactions from drawing logic.

<h2>Visualizing two data structures:</h2>
<p>
    When I did the lab for the first time, I had a difficult time grasping the 
    concept that heap and the explicit free list are two separate data 
    structures and that  
    the blocks in the free list may be out of address order. I wanted to 
    clearly establish that concept when describing the difference between the 
    implicit and explicit list. Hence, the explicit list has lines that point 
    blocks in the heap to their corresponding location in the free list.

<h2>Closing Thoughts:</h2>
<p>
    My goal was to communicate the concepts I struggled on with as few words as
    possible, relying on pictures and animations to do the heavy lifting. Not
    only did I strengthen my understanding of the material, but I also saw
    so much growth in my abilities to communicate complex ideas through 
    images. It was definitely an interesting challenge to find ways to create a 
    consistent visual language to visually represent different data structures 
    at play. However, I also had a lot of fun making use of my knowledge of 
    animation to portray abstract concepts in an engaging way. My favorite part 
    was when I used sinusoidal motion and a speed ramp to give the explicit list 
    a more organic feel. 
    <br><br>
    15-213 was one of the most challenging yet rewarding classes I have taken 
    at CMU. I not only learned about the intricacies of how computers work, but
    also saw so much growth in my abilities to design, write, and debug code. 
    When I first started the lab, I felt overwhelmed by how many small details
    I needed to keep track of to make the library work. My hope with this 
    project is to help future students feel less overwhelmed and appreciate how 
    beautiful this lab is.
