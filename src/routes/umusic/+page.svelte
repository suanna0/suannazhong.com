    April 2025-Sep 2025
</h3>
<p>
    I had the pleasure of creating motion graphics for 
    various <a href="https://www.universalmusic.com/" target="_blank">Universal 
    Music Group</a> artists through their in-house creative 
    solutions team, <a href="https://www.1824official.com/" target="_blank">º1824</a>. 
    My work during this time was confidential, but I'm happy to chat in person 
    about what the experience was like. Please reach out if you're interested in 
    learning more!
